HOW TO USE

-Proxy Lock uses the proximity sensor of the phone to lock/unlock the device. Best in case the phone's power button doesn't work well.

-Simply just wave your hand over the proximity sensor of the phone(located near the front camera) to Lock/Unlock the screen without even touching the phone.
